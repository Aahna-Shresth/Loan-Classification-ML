# Loan Classification using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on customer demographic and financial data using supervised learning algorithms.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle loan dataset with 13 features, including income, credit history, education, and more.

## Workflow
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and handled missing values
- Engineered features like Total Income and Income Bins
- Built models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost
- Final ensemble used Soft Voting for prediction

## Results
- Final Ensemble Model Accuracy: **84.4%**

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
